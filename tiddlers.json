About this demo\n\nThis demo contains two tiddlers [[foo]] and [[bar]] both are stored remotely and retrieved on demand.\nThe exact mechanism is as follows:\n\n* index.html contains all tiddlywiki related code including plugins and splitweb sync adapter.\n* The [[$:/config/splitweb/host]] tiddler contains the prefix to construct URI to tiddlers.json.\n* The tiddlers.json contains list of tiddlers available for this wiki. The information about the tiddler called skinny tiddler. It includes all information about tiddler except its text field.\n* When user accesses the tiddler the text of the tiddler is loaded from remote web server. \n* The directory structure of remote server is similar to the structure of nodejs based tiddlywiki. The only exception is the presence of tiddlers.json file in the root of the directory\n\n! Known limitations of the splitweb plugin\n\n* Currently it is not yet possible to specify a split filter. Which means only regular tiddlers created by user are stored in tiddlers.json. Which means plugins need to be included in index.html\n* The creation of a site helpers (Makefile) tested only under linux. Documentation for Windows users need to be written.",
